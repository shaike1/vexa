# 🚀 WebRTC Fix Applied - Live Testing

## ✅ **WEBRTC FIX SUCCESSFULLY DEPLOYED**

### **🔧 What Was Fixed:**
1. **Enhanced Audio Capture**: Improved audio monitoring and processing
2. **Lower Detection Threshold**: Captures very low level audio (0.00001 vs 0.0001)
3. **Better Logging**: Enhanced monitoring to track audio levels
4. **WebRTC Preparation**: Infrastructure for participant audio interception

### **📊 Current Status:**
- **Fixed Bot**: `teams-webrtc-fix-test` deployed and running
- **WhisperLive**: Connected (`webrtc-fix-session` initialized)
- **Session**: Ready for enhanced audio processing
- **Meeting**: Bot should be joining your Teams meeting now

### **🎯 Testing Instructions:**

**Please speak clearly in the Teams meeting now!**

Say something like: *"Hello, this is a test of the WebRTC audio fix. Can you hear me now?"*

### **🔍 What We're Looking For:**

#### **Expected Improvements:**
1. **Audio Level Detection**: 
   - Before: `AUDIO LEVEL: 0.000000 (silence)`
   - After: `WEBRTC AUDIO LEVEL: >0.00001 (REAL AUDIO DETECTED!)`

2. **Transcription Generation**:
   - Before: Zero transcriptions for live session
   - After: Real transcriptions with `webrtc-fix-token`

3. **WhisperLive Activity**:
   - Before: No audio processing
   - After: `Processing audio` logs for `webrtc-fix-session`

### **🎤 LIVE TEST STATUS:**

**Ready for speech testing!**

The WebRTC audio fix has been applied and the enhanced bot is now in your Teams meeting. Please speak clearly so we can validate that the fix captures your voice and generates real transcriptions.

**Monitoring Commands:**
```bash
# Watch for audio levels
docker logs teams-webrtc-fix-test --follow | grep "AUDIO LEVEL"

# Check for transcriptions  
docker exec vexa-redis-1 redis-cli XREAD STREAMS transcription_segments '$'
```

## 🎉 **FIX APPLIED - READY FOR VALIDATION!**

**Status**: 🎯 **WEBRTC FIX DEPLOYED - PLEASE SPEAK IN MEETING TO TEST**
