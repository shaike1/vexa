# Vexa AI v0.6 MS Teams Integration Analysis

## Executive Summary

Vexa AI has successfully solved the MS Teams audio streaming issue that we were struggling with. Their v0.6 release (October 4, 2025) introduces a completely refactored, production-ready approach to MS Teams audio capture and real-time transcription. The key breakthrough is their **browser-based audio capture architecture** using Web Audio API with sophisticated DOM element monitoring.

## 🚀 Key Breakthrough: How They Solved MS Teams Audio

### 1. **Browser-Based Audio Capture Architecture**
Instead of trying to capture audio at the system level, Vexa v0.6 captures audio directly from DOM media elements using Web Audio API:

```javascript
// Core audio capture approach
async findMediaElements(): Promise<HTMLMediaElement[]> {
  const mediaElements = Array.from(
    document.querySelectorAll("audio, video")
  ).filter((el: any) => 
    !el.paused && 
    el.srcObject instanceof MediaStream && 
    el.srcObject.getAudioTracks().length > 0
  ) as HTMLMediaElement[];
}

async createCombinedAudioStream(mediaElements: HTMLMediaElement[]): Promise<MediaStream> {
  // Creates a combined audio stream from all active media elements
  const sourceNode = this.audioContext.createMediaStreamSource(elementStream);
  sourceNode.connect(this.destinationNode);
}
```

### 2. **Advanced Speaker Detection System**
Sophisticated speaker detection based on Teams-specific DOM selectors and visual indicators:

```javascript
// Teams-specific voice level detection
// voice-level-stream-outline element: visible = SILENT, hidden = SPEAKING
const isCurrentlySpeaking = hasVoiceLevelElement ? !isVoiceLevelVisible : isNowVisiblySpeaking;
```

### 3. **Platform-Agnostic Architecture**
Clean separation of concerns with modular platform strategies:

```
platforms/
  shared/meetingFlow.ts     # Cross-platform orchestration
  msteams/
    index.ts               # Teams handler entry point
    join.ts                # Teams-specific joining logic
    admission.ts           # Admission waiting logic
    recording.ts           # Audio capture and speaker detection
    leave.ts               # Leave logic
    removal.ts             # Removal monitoring
    selectors.ts           # Teams-specific DOM selectors
```

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Container-Based Deployment
```yaml
# docker-compose.yml structure
services:
  api-gateway:          # Routes API requests
  bot-manager:          # Manages bot lifecycle  
  vexa-bot:            # The actual bot container
  whisperlive:         # Real-time transcription
  transcription-collector: # Processes transcripts
  redis:               # Message queue
  postgres:            # Data storage
```

### Bot Deployment Pattern
```bash
# Single command deployment
make all TARGET=gpu  # GPU setup with better quality
make all            # CPU setup for development
```

### Audio Processing Pipeline
1. **Media Element Detection**: Scans for active `<audio>` and `<video>` elements with MediaStreams
2. **Stream Combination**: Creates combined audio stream using Web Audio API
3. **Real-time Processing**: Resamples to 16kHz and sends to WhisperLive via WebSocket
4. **Speaker Detection**: Monitors DOM changes to detect speaking participants
5. **Stubborn Reconnection**: Never-give-up WebSocket reconnection for reliability

## 🎯 Key Selectors for Teams Integration

### Critical Teams DOM Selectors
```javascript
// Participant detection
teamsParticipantSelectors = [
  '[data-tid="roster-grid-item"]',
  '[data-stream-type]',
  '[role="main"] [data-tid]'
];

// Voice level indicators (PRIMARY for speaking detection)
teamsVoiceLevelSelectors = [
  '.voice-level-stream-outline'  // visible = SILENT, hidden = SPEAKING
];

// Audio activity indicators  
teamsAudioActivitySelectors = [
  '[data-tid="audio-activity-indicator"]',
  '.speaking-indicator-animation'
];
```

### Speaking Detection Logic
```javascript
// Core Teams speaking detection
const voiceLevelElement = participantElement.querySelector('.voice-level-stream-outline');
const isVoiceLevelVisible = voiceLevelElement && isElementActuallyVisible(voiceLevelElement);

// Teams logic: voice-level outline visible = SILENT, hidden = SPEAKING
let isCurrentlySpeaking = hasVoiceLevelElement ? !isVoiceLevelVisible : isNowVisiblySpeaking;
```

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions for orc-3001

### 1. Clone and Setup Vexa v0.6
```bash
# On orc-3001
cd /root
git clone https://github.com/Vexa-ai/vexa.git vexa-v0.6
cd vexa-v0.6

# GPU setup (recommended for production)
make all TARGET=gpu
```

### 2. API Usage for MS Teams
```bash
# Deploy a Teams bot
curl -X POST http://localhost:18056/bots \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: your-api-key" \
  -d '{
    "platform": "teams",
    "native_meeting_id": "NUMERIC_MEETING_ID",
    "passcode": "MEETING_PASSCODE"
  }'

# Get transcripts
curl -H "X-API-Key: your-api-key" \
  "http://localhost:18056/transcripts/teams/NUMERIC_MEETING_ID"
```

### 3. Container Management
```bash
# View services
make ps

# View logs
make logs

# Stop services
make down
```

## 🔍 Comparison with Our Previous Approach

### What We Were Doing Wrong
1. **System-level audio capture**: Trying to capture audio at OS level
2. **WebSocket proxy approach**: Creating unnecessary HTTP bridge mode
3. **Host-based operations**: Running components outside containers
4. **Manual dependency management**: Not using containerized approach

### What Vexa v0.6 Does Right
1. **Browser-level audio capture**: Direct DOM media element access
2. **Container-to-container networking**: All services in Docker with proper networking
3. **Platform-specific selectors**: Detailed Teams DOM understanding
4. **Stubborn reconnection**: Never-give-up WebSocket reliability
5. **Comprehensive speaker detection**: Multiple detection mechanisms

## 🎯 Key Lessons for Our Implementation

### 1. Browser Audio Capture is the Way
```javascript
// The breakthrough: capture from DOM elements, not system audio
const mediaElements = document.querySelectorAll("audio, video")
  .filter(el => el.srcObject instanceof MediaStream);
```

### 2. Teams-Specific Voice Detection
```javascript
// Teams uses voice-level-stream-outline as primary indicator
// COUNTER-INTUITIVE: visible = silent, hidden = speaking
const isCurrentlySpeaking = !isVoiceLevelVisible;
```

### 3. Container-First Architecture
- Everything runs in containers
- Container-to-container networking
- No host-based operations
- Simplified deployment with `make all`

### 4. Stubborn WebSocket Connections
```javascript
// Never-give-up reconnection logic
private maxRetries: number = Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER;
// Exponential backoff with continuous retries
```

## 🚧 Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Deploy Vexa v0.6 (Immediate)
1. Deploy Vexa v0.6 on orc-3001 alongside our current system
2. Test with real Teams meetings
3. Validate audio quality and speaker detection

### Phase 2: Integration Assessment

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Browser Audio Service (Core Innovation)
```javascript
class BrowserAudioService {
  // Finds active media elements with audio streams
  async findMediaElements(): Promise<HTMLMediaElement[]>
  
  // Creates combined audio stream from multiple sources
  async createCombinedAudioStream(mediaElements: HTMLMediaElement[]): Promise<MediaStream>
  
  // Sets up real-time audio processing pipeline
  async initializeAudioProcessor(combinedStream: MediaStream): Promise<any>
}
```

### WebSocket Service with Stubborn Reconnection
```javascript
class BrowserWhisperLiveService {
  // NEVER-GIVE-UP reconnection mode
  private maxRetries: number = Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER;
  
  // Exponential backoff with max 10s delay
