### **Diagnostic Monitoring Active**
The bot is now live in the Teams meeting with our diagnostic audio level monitoring. To complete the validation:

1. **Speak in the meeting** - Say something clearly
2. **Monitor logs** for audio level detection
3. **Check transcriptions** in Redis

### **Expected Results During Test**

**When you speak in the meeting, we should see:**

#### Current State (Problem):
```bash
🔇 AUDIO LEVEL: 0.000000 (SILENCE - this causes "You" transcriptions)
```

#### Or if audio is detected:
```bash
🎵 AUDIO LEVEL: 0.045231 (REAL AUDIO DETECTED!)
```

## 🎯 **TEST VALIDATION**

### **What We've Proven So Far:**
- ✅ Bot successfully deploys to real Teams meetings
- ✅ WhisperLive connection and initialization works
- ✅ Meeting participant detection working
- ✅ Audio system setup functional

### **Next Phase - Audio Testing:**
To complete our validation, please:

1. **Join the Teams meeting** yourself
2. **Speak clearly** into your microphone
3. **Watch the bot logs** for audio level monitoring
