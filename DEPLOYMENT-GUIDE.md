# Vexa Real-Time Transcription - Deployment Guide

## 🎯 Quick Start: Deploy on System with Microphone

This guide helps you deploy the working Vexa transcription system on a computer with physical microphone hardware.

### Prerequisites
- System with working microphone (laptop, desktop with mic, etc.)
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Node.js 18+ installed
- Git access to this repository

### Step 1: Deploy WhisperLive Service

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone [your-repo-url]
cd vexa

# Start WhisperLive container
COMPOSE_PROFILES=cpu docker compose up -d

# Verify WhisperLive is running
docker ps | grep whisperlive
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
cd services/vexa-bot/core
npm install
```

### Step 3: Start the Bridge Server

```bash
# Start the simple bridge in background
node simple-bridge.js &
```

### Step 4: Test Your Microphone

```bash
# Check available audio devices
arecord -l

# Test microphone capture (should show audio devices)
pactl list sources short
```

### Step 5: Start Real-Time Transcription

```bash
# Start desktop audio router
node desktop-audio-router.js
```

You should see:
```
🎤 Desktop Audio Router Starting...
=====================================
[Desktop Audio] ✅ Connected to bridge
🎤 Capturing MICROPHONE AUDIO (your voice)
🎯 READY FOR TRANSCRIPTION!
```

### Step 6: Speak and See Transcription

**Speak into your microphone** - transcription results will appear in real-time!

## 🔧 Architecture

```
Your Voice → Microphone → Desktop Audio Router → Simple Bridge → WhisperLive → Transcription
```

## 📁 Key Files

- `desktop-audio-router.js` - Captures microphone audio
- `simple-bridge.js` - Routes audio to WhisperLive  
- `docker-compose.yml` - WhisperLive service container

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### No Audio Devices
```bash
# Check hardware
arecord -l
# Should show: card 0: device 0 (or similar)
```

### No Transcription Output
```bash
# Check WhisperLive logs
docker logs vexa-whisperlive-cpu-2 --tail 20
```

### Connection Issues
```bash
# Verify bridge is running
netstat -tlnp | grep 8771
```

## ✅ Success Indicators

1. **Bridge Connected**: "Connected to bridge" message
2. **WhisperLive Ready**: Docker logs show "CLIENT connected"  
3. **Audio Flowing**: Occasional "Sent X bytes" messages
4. **Transcription**: Real text output of your speech

## 🎊 Result

When working correctly, you'll see your spoken words transcribed in real-time as you speak into the microphone!
